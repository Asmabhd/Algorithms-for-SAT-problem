# Algorithms-for-SAT-problem
Algorithms for SAT problem in JAVA An implementation of different approaches to solve the satisfiability problem (SAT) using blind, heuristic and metaheuristic methods.
The goal is to use different algorithms implementing blind search methods (depth first DFS),
heuristic (A*) and metaheuristic methods such as the GA genetic algorithm, and ACO
in order to find solutions to instances of the SAT problem.
